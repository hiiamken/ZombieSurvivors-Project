Set up the entire base structure of the game using Saxion GameApp.
This task includes creating the initial Java project, integrating the Saxion GameApp library, setting up the folder architecture, creating the main game class and the first playable screen, and validating that the project runs correctly for all team members.
This task is the foundation of Sprint 1 and must be completed before any gameplay features can be implemented.



To-Do List (Checklist)

Create Java Project & Add Saxion GameApp

Create new Java project (IntelliJ, Java 17/21)

Add Saxion GameApp dependency to Gradle/Maven
